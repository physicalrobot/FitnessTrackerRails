# Fitness Tracker

## Learning Goals

  frontend

## Introduction

This is app tracks the workouts you plan to do at the gym. You can create, edit, delete and schedule workouts to specific days on the calendar.

The focus of this project is **building a Rails API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.A more in depth explanation of the project and how its made can be found here: https://physicalrobot.github.io/code_blog/portfolio/fitness-app-with-user-authentication/
